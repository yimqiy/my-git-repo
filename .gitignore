WHAT TO IGNORE?

Typically, we ignore files like build artifacts and generated files that are usually derived from the human-authored code in the repository. E.g.
- dependency caches like /node_modules
- compiled code like .o, .pyc files
- build output directories like /bin, /out
- runtime-generated files like log files
- personal configuration files e.g. of your IDE
